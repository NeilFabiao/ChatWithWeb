Jarvis 🤖🔗 is designed to streamline the process of summarizing and answering questions from specific websites. This tool excels in extracting precise information and responding to detailed queries from lengthy texts, proving invaluable for researchers, students, and anyone eager to quickly obtain insights from online materials.

### Simple Use Case Example:
**Background**: Jordan, a student, is researching the latest trends in machine learning for a school project but is constrained by time.

**Use Case**: Utilizing Jarvis 🤖🔗, set to dissect Lilian Weng's comprehensive blog post, Jordan requests, "Can you provide a summary of the main points discussed in this article?" After receiving a succinct overview, he delves deeper, asking, "What does Lilian Weng predict about the future of reinforcement learning?"

**Outcome**: Jarvis's prompt assistance enables Jordan to swiftly gather an essential summary and detailed answers, significantly aiding his research and allowing him to concentrate on his project with well-sourced information.

### Additional Use Cases:
- **Conversational AI for Business**: Integrate Jarvis into corporate intranets to offer employees instant access to critical company information, diminishing the need for extensive searches.

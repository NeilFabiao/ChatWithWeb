    st.markdown(""" ## Project Overview

This application, Jarvis ðŸ¤–ðŸ”—, is designed to assist with summarization and question answering from a specific website. It is particularly useful for extracting concise information and answering specific questions from extensive text materials, making it an ideal tool for researchers, students, and anyone looking to quickly gather insights from web content.

### Simple Use Case Example:
**Background**: Jordan, a student, needs to understand the latest trends in machine learning for a school project but has limited time to read through extensive materials.

**Use Case**: Jordan uses Jarvis ðŸ¤–ðŸ”—, which is set to analyze Lilian Weng's insightful blog post. Jordan asks, "Can you provide a summary of the main points discussed in this article?" Following the summary, Jordan queries more specific information, "What does Lilian Weng say about the future of reinforcement learning?"

**Outcome**: With Jarvis's assistance, Jordan quickly obtains a clear summary and specific answers, enhancing the efficiency of his research and enabling him to focus on compiling his project with well-informed content.

### Additional Use Cases:
- **Conversational AI for Business**: Corporate users integrate Jarvis into their intranet to provide employees with instant answers from company documents, reducing time spent searching for information.
- **Customer Support Automation**: Companies use Jarvis to answer common customer queries based on their product manuals and FAQ sections, improving customer service efficiency.
